React GitHub User Finder allows users to search for a user's repo list and orgs list using their username.

Please make sure to have node installed on your machine in order to successfully run the application.

To run the project simply "clone it", access the "terminal", cd into the project "root" folder, type in "npm install", once the installation is finished, type in "npm start" and just like magic a browser tab will be opened with the application running.
